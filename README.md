    -	Email have access to GitHub repository and can push changes
    
    -	Email can login to azure project via GitHub login
    
    -	SonarCloud access to check code analysis reports
    
  -	Clone solution from GitHub repository
  
  -	Open solution with visual studio (minimum version 2017)
  
  -	Build solution 
  
  -	Open command window and redirect to solution path
  
  -	Enter “docker-compose up” command to build all containers
